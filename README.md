# latte-universe

Welcome to the default Latte repository. When you install Latte, the repository that comes initially is the `Seanld` repo, which is directed at this URL (https://github.com/Seanld/latte-universe).

## All Packages

* **mean-averager**: A simple utility that takes _all_ of its arguments as integers and returns the average (AKA mean) of them as a float, and outputs it on the screen.

## Submit Your Own

If you want to get your package on this repository, just send me a pull request with your `.tar.gz` package included with it. I'll check it out, and you may just get yours published here. However, I would recommend just creating a new GitHub repository and hosting your own Latte repository there. It would be a lot simpler.

The only case where you would want to submit your own package to this repository is if you wanted your package to be a default package that comes with Standard, untouched Latte.
